I am a Ph.D. student in Business Economics at Harvard, where I am supported by the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) and [Opportunity Insights](https://opportunityinsights.org/).

I graduated from Harvard with an A.B. in Physics & Mathematics. Before starting my Ph.D., I was a management consultant at [Bain & Company](https://www.bain.com/) and a research assistant at the [National Bureau of Economic Research](https://www.nber.org/). Before economics, I did research in computational biology.

My research studies agency frictions and their impacts on financial markets, using tools from public finance, industrial organization, and econometrics.
