title: "Margin or Mission? The Effects of CEOs on Hospital Outcomes"
authors: "Nagisa Tadjfar"
abstract: "This paper provides suggestive evidence from US hospitals that hospital CEOs tend to systematically increase or decrease charity care and other financial outcomes across the different hospitals. Using the large mobility of hospital CEOs in the US between 1996-2019, we classify CEOs into quartile cells based on percent changes in charity care and margins they are associated with across their hospitals of employment. For each hospital-CEO pair, we construct leave-one- out quartile cells to classify CEOs based on changes they are associated with at other hospitals for each outcome. Within 3 years of the appointment of a “top quartile” CEO who is associated with increased charity care at other hospitals, the share of expenses devoted to charity care increases by 40%-90% relative to hospitals who hire first, second, or third quartile CEOs. We also find large and significant effects on outcomes such as total margin, gross revenue, and occupancy. Hospitals appointing CEOs with “top quartile” and “bottom quartile” effects on charity care and margins are not on differential trends and are observationally similar."
